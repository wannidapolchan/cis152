          <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
          <p>
            Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
            Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, ans a
            roof dome that can be opened.

        <section>
          <h3>How are the yurts finished?</h3>
          <p>
            Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and
            gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience include electricity
            and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom
            facilities are locate in the lodge.

          <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
          <p>
            Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
            changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to
            bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
